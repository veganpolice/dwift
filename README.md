# Integrated Makerspace Development Strategy for 2306 Read Place Affordable Housing Project  

## Executive Summary  
This report outlines how DWIFT Housing Society will leverage Create Makerspace's existing fabrication capabilities (located at 39449 Queens Way, Squamish) to prefabricate building components for the proposed 28-unit development at 2306 Read Place. The construction site at 2306 Read Place will serve as the primary location for assembly and structural construction using prefabricated components. By integrating open-source design principles and local fabrication, DWIFT aims to achieve 18-22% cost savings while prioritizing housing access for participating tradespeople and professionals. This approach addresses Squamish's urgent need for affordable housing and establishes a replicable model for flood-resistant, climate-adaptive construction.

## Project-Specific Integration Strategy  

### 1. Makerspace-Driven Prefabrication Model  

#### **Fabrication Hub: Create Makerspace (39449 Queens Way)**  
Create Makerspace will serve as the central hub for producing prefabricated building components, utilizing its advanced equipment and expertise:  
- **CNC Router**: Precision cutting of modular wall panels, cabinetry, and millwork.  
- **3D Printers**: Prototyping custom fixtures and small-scale structural elements.  
- **Metal Shop**: Fabrication of steel connectors, brackets, and other structural components.  
- **Laser Cutters**: Production of detailed ventilation screens, façade patterns, and trim elements.  

Key prefabricated components include:  
- Modular wall assemblies (flood-resistant composite cores).  
- Elevated foundation systems designed for floodplain compliance.  
- Custom cabinetry and interior millwork tailored to unit layouts.  

#### **Assembly & Construction Site: 2306 Read Place**  
The 36,167 sq. ft. lot at 2306 Read Place will be used exclusively for on-site assembly and structural construction:  
- **Component Assembly Zone**: On-site assembly of prefabricated wall panels, plumbing trees, and steel frames fabricated at Create Makerspace.  
- **Structural Construction**: Erection of townhouse and condo units using modular components delivered from the makerspace.  
- **Temporary Workshop**: A mobile CNC plasma table and welding stations will be installed on-site for final adjustments to steel components during assembly.  

This dual-location model ensures efficient production at Create Makerspace while minimizing logistical challenges during on-site construction.

### 2. Workforce Housing Priority Program  

DWIFT will implement a "Build-to-Own" initiative that prioritizes housing access for tradespeople and professionals contributing to the project:  

| Contribution Tier | Housing Access Priority | Example Roles | Target Units |  
|--------------------|-------------------------|---------------|-------------|  
| 500+ hours         | First right of refusal  | Carpenters, CNC operators | 8 townhouses |  
| 300-499 hours      | Waitlist preference     | Electricians, plumbers    | 5 studios    |  
| 100-299 hours      | Shared equity options   | Design professionals      | 3 in-law suites |  

Contributors will log hours through Create Makerspace's membership portal or on-site job tracking systems at 2306 Read Place. This program directly aligns workforce participation with affordable housing access while fostering community ownership of the project.

## Strategic Local Partnerships  

### Core Construction Partners  
DWIFT will collaborate with local businesses to streamline production and construction processes:  
- **CSI Metal Fabricators**: Prefabrication of steel frames and connectors in partnership with Create Makerspace’s metal shop.  
- **Sea to Sky Plumbing & Gas**: Modular plumbing trees fabricated off-site for quick installation during assembly at 2306 Read Place.  
- **Squamish Welding & Steel**: Custom metalwork for balconies, staircases, and flood-resistant foundation systems.

### Professional Services Network  
DWIFT will engage local architects, engineers, and trade instructors under a shared equity model to ensure high-quality design and execution:  
- Architects will provide modular designs optimized for prefabrication at Create Makerspace.  
- Engineers will collaborate on flood-resistant foundation systems tailored to Squamish’s unique environmental conditions.

## Open-Source Design Implementation  

### BOSS Framework Adaptation (Fabrication at Create Makerspace)  

DWIFT will adapt Building Open Source Software (BOSS) designs to meet Squamish-specific requirements:  

1. **Flood Mitigation Features** (Prefabricated at Create):  
   - Elevated mechanical systems (fabricated steel platforms).  
   - Flood-drainage wall cavities with rot-resistant materials cut using CNC routers.

2. **Modular Densification Solutions** (Assembled at 2306 Read Place):  
   - Stackable townhouse modules fabricated off-site for rapid assembly on-site.  
   - Convertible studio/1BR units with shared amenity spaces.

## Financial Model Integration  

### Cost Reduction Analysis  

| Component            | Conventional Cost   | Makerspace Cost       | Savings (%)    | Fabrication Location       |  
|----------------------|---------------------|-----------------------|----------------|----------------------------|  
| Kitchen Cabinets     | $12,500/unit       | $4,200/unit           | 66%            | Create Makerspace          |  
| Stair Systems        | $8,000/unit        | $3,500/unit           | 56%            | Create Makerspace          |  
| Exterior Cladding    | $22,000/unit       | $14,000/unit          | 36%            | Create Makerspace          |

*Total Project Savings:* $1.8M-$2.2M across all units.

## Implementation Timeline  

### Phase 1: Acquisition & Fabrication Setup (Months 0–6)  
- Finalize property purchase ($1.825M target).  
- Begin component prototyping at Create Makerspace (e.g., modular wall panels).  

### Phase 2: Fabrication & On-Site Assembly (Months 6–18)  
- Ramp up prefabrication efforts at Create Makerspace to produce key components for all units (60% of total components).  
- Deliver prefabricated modules to the construction site at 2306 Read Place for assembly by trained local workers.

### Phase 3: Occupancy & Expansion (Months 18–24)  
- Complete final inspections of assembled units at the construction site.  
- Transition makerspace-trained contributors into priority housing units.

## Risk Mitigation  

### Technical Assurance Protocols
1. **Quality Control**:
   - Prefabricated components undergo batch testing at Create Makerspace before delivery.
   - On-site adjustments made using mobile CNC plasma tools during assembly.
   
2. **Logistics Management**:
   - Just-in-time delivery schedules from Create Makerspace to minimize storage needs at the construction site.
   - Real-time tracking of component production through digital inventory systems.
